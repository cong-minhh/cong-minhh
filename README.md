## About Me

I am a software developer who enjoys building systems that work well. I work on everything from web apps to real-time robot communication. I like solving hard problems and learning how to make things better.

## What I Do

### Cloud & Infrastructure
I work with Kubernetes to manage applications across multiple servers. I set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to check system health, and I use Docker and CI/CD pipelines to automate my work.

### Robotics & IoT
I have worked on standardizing robot communication using VDA5050. I built a service to stream robot data in real-time using MQTT and Python, which helps track performance and status.

### Full Stack Development
I build complete applications for the web and mobile.
*   **Web:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.
*   **Mobile:** React Native, Expo.
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Spring Boot, Python (FastAPI), C#.

### Data & AI
I build applications that handle data using databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I have also integrated AI tools to help generate content automatically.
